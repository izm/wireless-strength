Wireless Strength
=================

This is a set of two scripts: wireless-strength, ws-plot

wireless-strength
-----------------

Usage: wireless-strength [interval]
       interval: the length in seconds between polls, default=2

Print your wireless signal strength to the console at set intervals.
A log of the session is also created in the directory with the date
and time the sessions was started and a .dat extension.  This requires
"nm-tool", a command-line tool that is part of network-manager.

ws-plot
-------

Usage: ws-plot <filename.dat> [<filename2.dat>]

Create a png graph of the session using a "dat" file created by
wireless-strength.  This requires gnuplot to be installed.


Examples
--------

# Start polling at 5 second intervals, Ctrl+c to stop
$ ./wireless-strength 5

# Start polling at 2 second intervals - the default
$ ./wireless-strength

# Create a graph from the dat file created in the above session
$ ./ws-plot 2012.05.27-16.42.29.dat 

The created png will be named the same as the dat file, with .png attached.
2012.05.27-16.42.29.dat.png

# Create graphs from all dat files in the directory
$ ./ws-plot *.dat
